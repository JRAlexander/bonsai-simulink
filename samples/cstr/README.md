# Chemical Process Optimization

The process considered here is a Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) during transition from low to high conversion rate (high to low residual concentration). Because the chemical reaction is exothermic (produces heat), the reactor temperature must be controlled to prevent a thermal runaway. The control task is complicated by the fact that the process dynamics are nonlinear and transition from stable to unstable and back to stable as the conversion rate increases. The reactor dynamics are modeled in Simulink. The controlled variables (states) are the residual concentration  and the reactor temperature , and the manipulated variable (action) is the temperature  of the coolant circulating in the reactor's cooling jacket.

This example shows how to use Project Bonsaiï¿½s Machine Teaching strategies to learn a controller for a chemical reactor transitioning from low to high conversion rate. For background, see Seborg, D.E. et al., "Process Dynamics and Control", 2nd Ed., 2004, Wiley, pp. 34-36. This sample is largely adapted from the MathWorks' [Gain scheduled control of a chemical reactor](https://www.mathworks.com/help/control/ug/gain-scheduled-control-of-a-chemical-reactor.html).

## Actions (Manipulated Variables)

Bare minimum for the sim:

| Action | Continuous Value | Units |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| dTc | [-20, 20] | [Kelvin] |

Final set for **bonsai training**:

- Performance improved when making the brain learn the per-timestep adjustment to apply to previous dTc.
- Thus, we maintained control to be dTc_adjust, and added an accumulator on sim side.

| Action | Continuous Value | Units |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| dTc_adjust | [-5, 5]* | [Kelvin/min] |

*Note, given an additional rule that requires keeping dTc changes at no more than 10 Kelvins/min, we forced dTc_adjust to be on the [-5, 5] range (for Ts=0.5min)

## States (Control Variables)

Which matches the set of Observable States used for **bonsai training**

| State | Continuous Value | Units |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Cr | [0.1, 12] | [kmol/m3] |
| Tr | [10, 800] | [Kelvin] |
| Tc | [10, 800] | [Kelvin] |
| Cref | [0.1, 12] | [kmol/m3] |

- Note, .ink file defines ranges higher than the ones shown here. That is made in purpose since the brain will try to explore, and thus will hit extreme limits in doing so.

*Tref was removed as observable state since brain to simplify brain's training. With Bonsai's solution we don't need Tref to be able to drive the concentration linearly from one point to the next.


## Constraints

- Tc < 10 degrees / min
- Tr < 400 to prevent thermal runaway
